Joshua W.,"To me, technology means access, opportunity, and power. ","Technology provides the gateways to innovation, resources, and quality of life. It can improve how we learn, receive healthcare, communicate, etc.","What scares me about technology is its potential to create a digital divide for those without access to it. Technology is such a powerful tool. However, without access to the tool, many people lack the opportunities technology offers, leaving them behind in a technologically driven world.","In the context of technology and society, I would define ""collective good"" as an assurance that all have access to technological opportunities, regardless of geographical location, race, gender, income, etc.","As a strategic leader in digital access, broadband connectivity, public interest technology, and responsible AI, I am committed to enhancing opportunities and promoting technology solutions centered around people. My work and values align with (m)otherboard's mission to shape technology for the collective good."
Mark R.,,"I'm interested in technology that actually brings people together (not the false connections of social media). I'm interested in technology for creative innovation, as a tool and an inspiration (not as a replacement for human workers). ","I hope our future robot overlords have empathy toward the first living creatures on earth, that they solve the crises in climate and government without intentionally killing too many billions of us. ",,
Jessica C.,"At its best, technology means expanded possibility and agency for everyone, not just those who already have power and resources.",It's been the same for me since Web 1.0: its capacity to serve as a powerful tool for human creativity and connection.,Right now: the extraction of public resources and the enclosure of public knowledge.,"It means developing and implementing technological systems that prioritize shared wellbeing, equitable access, and community empowerment. It means technology as commons.","I'm a digital librarian and my work is about flipping the script on how technology increasingly works in our society by creating digital spaces that are truly open, and that center equity, accessibility, and human values."

Lori C.,"I have a complicated relationship with technology. My Dad invented one of the first personal computers, so I grew up having the latest and greatest technological innovations at the time. I was inseparable from my Sony Walkman, as music is and always has been my safe place. My grandmother said I'd lose my hearing by the time I was 20 because I listened to music too loud on my headphones, and she was partially correct. But that was the 1990s and I was a kid. As an adult in the 2020s, I'm constantly bombarded with screens and notifications. I find myself longing for a time when screen culture and smartphones were nothing more than a Philip K. Dick novel. I've tried to make changes in my own life (using a typewriter, drawing on paper instead of my ipad, taking photos with a film camera, reading the *newspaper* again, listening to vinyl) and I love that, but I do feel cautious about the societal implications of our ""modern world.""","Technology, like many human inventions and discoveries, only reflects ourselves back to us. That is, whatever our values are as a culture will be magnified by tech. Thus, if we rely on the better angels of our nature, remember our goodness, and wish others well, technology will follow that. If we are greedy and devalue one another, technology will follow that too. I believe in human goodness, though, and thus the idea that innovations in communication and coalition-building is quite exciting.","So much! Primarily two categories, though: that as we continue to submerge ourselves into the isolation and flatness of screen culture, we will become a more lonely society that does not seek real experiences, and as a result, we live in a tragic little echo chamber, never challenged and never truly connected.
The second thing that there has been such an incongruent emphasis placed on tech that as a result the arts have been culturally devalued. This is best exemplified by AI. A technology that is killing the planet is also being used to kill the arts. It was already hard enough to be an artist in this century (thanks to both an economy that makes living on art impossible and also political decisions that have impacted how the arts are funded). We were already barely surviving. Then the Tech Gods came and decided robots could write and make films for us. My heart is broken. But I'm not giving up on the arts, as if I could, and I'm not giving up on humanity, as if I should. ",,"I'm a writer and film director, and I believe that the medium of film can be used to this degree in several ways. For example, let's say I make a film about queer kids in high school. I set up a social media and web presence for the film, wherein audiences or prospective audiences can come and converse, share experiences via UGC, and perhaps find safety and solidarity within that virtual community. My films are very unique in terms of stylized dialogue and my attempts to bring visual formalism to comedy. Perhaps technology can connect me and my work with other weirdos who see the world the way I do. "
Aleksandra M.,"It's whatever tools humans develop through their ingenuity. Although, these days when I hear the word technology, it evokes mostly gadgets, computers and the internet, as that's the stuff that creates most controversies and is most invasive in our public and private lives.","That it could help people with tasks that are mundane, it could make work more efficient so that we can spend more time on things that matter, like our relationships and caring for the planet.",That it divides us and is so addictive and ubiquitous. That it normalizes violence. That it is so difficult to regulate tech giants.

Jennifer B.,"So many things ... ultimately it feels like fire. It can be used to destroy a house or cook a meal. It's transformative, but all in how you wield it responsibly. ",I keep waiting for it to enable us to work less instead of just be expected to do more all the time. But the ability for it to connect people and solve shared problems across time and space is still motivating for me. ,The incentive structures and personalities driving the current scaled platforms and the damage they're able to do (and have done). ,,"I have a company with two technology products that are built for responsive, collective action and not extraction. It's hard to fund these but they're so needed! "
Darby S.,"Unfortunately, I have mostly negative connotations when the word technology comes across my path. Overall, while technology has had positive impacts, I'm sad to report that I feel there have been more negative impacts. If we used the Precautionary Principle to roll out, say, the internet at large, we might have thought through some more checks and balances and considered a future state that would undoubtedly be used for bad. I like the wheel, though...an early tech advancement. :) ","How we can leverage it for mutual aid, social impact, and to combat the use of it for bad via the technocrats vision of our collective future. I also appreciate being able to communicate at scale and to remain in touch with loved ones. ","Silicon Valley billionaires (Yarvin as their philosophical guide) using technology exactly as they say they will, all in the name of freedom. Ha! And also, that we have fewer in person, human to human interactions, which sets the stage for ""othering"", fear, and isolation, creating a perfect stage for fascism to take hold. ",,"It doesn't really, at least as far as digital tech is concerned. But as far as the work I'm doing (arts + education via community building and producing a documentary) and the technology leveraged for that and the initial plans towards building demonstrable regenerative communities - that's lower grade tech that is and will play a part in the overall mission. "
BÃ¡lint M.,"It's a facilitator of creation, of connections to others, it's an assistance, a form of expression","The accessibility, ease, and velocity of dreaming up something and then seeing it manifest","Using it to exploit people, nature",,"As an all-around creative person I try to bring joy and thoughtfulness to the communities I'm in, educating those close to me about the benefits and dangers of technology in general, helping them take ownership of their hardware and software, fostering anti-capitalist views by aspiring towards acts of sustainable community self-fulfillment"
Jocelyn M.,"For me, technology is the ways we do things as humans - communicate, build, govern, survive.","I get excited about the ways technology can enhance and amplify the very best of humanity - our ability to connect, to care for one another, to dream.","I'm afraid of the ways technology can enhance and amplify the very worst of humanity - greed, individualism, callousness, scapegoating, power over, self-indulgence.",,I'm out in these streets building toward liberation and fighting fascism everywhere and every way I can <3 Love you all and your amazing work!
Fin,"The fine balance between convenience enabling connection and that same convenience masquerading as community. Knowing when the slow dopamine drip of a poke, like, or repost has in fact replaced the humanin interaction critical and intrinsic to building a better life.","The intersection of analog and digital and built in affordances that allow disconnecting and reconnecting consciously. Also, books are still pretty great tech.","We have nothing to fear but fear itself ...although complacency and acceptance of what is already on offer vs a willingness and even desire to hack together what's needed and useful",,"I'm building connections through shared stories using one of the oldest technologies out there: books. Building community and platforms of sharing is critical to protecting the rights of everyone. The available platforms of news and information (not the same thing) are failing to transmit the signal through the noise. Frustration is leading many to disengage, only to return due to a lack of alternatives. There's the old school DIY solution of local zines, flyers, and in-person meetings. But to refuse the advantages of virtual connection, reaching beyond the local geography, past our immediate areas of available expertise, would be foolish. To restate simply, the surprise successes Bookstagram & Booktok have brought to authors âparticularly prior to the influencer boomâ is proof positive of peoples desires for stories, their desire to share stories, and even more, to find self in the stories they read. Blended reading (books, eBooks, and audiobooks) is becoming the norm and finding ways aside from Bookshop.org and Libro.fm to encourage storytelling, connection, and dissemination of authors who've touched our lives is a necessary next step. We are entering an era where FanFic is the norm, where inspiration and riffing are accepted and embraced, and in many ways returning to the old ways of storytelling, putting a flavor or a spin on a well told tale to make it ours. Not as plagiarism, but as a necessity to ensure that story is applicable to people across walks of life, across experience. Mapping those paths of inspiration, of riffs and quotes âlike in film, where a single frame can be the call back to a movie that inspired the directorâ builds a deeper stronger story. Decoupling that storytelling from capitalist gain, or anyway ensuring that, rather than stealing, we are being inspired, giving thanks to those whose work we base our own upon. All this? It needs a platform, and a card catalog just won't cut it.

...oh, and meanwhile I'll be making sure books aren't shadow banned out of print by ensuring those used copies get passed along, reread, and kept accessible, even as publishers cave to the fearful demands of the few. "
