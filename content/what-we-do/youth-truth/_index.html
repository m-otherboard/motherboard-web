<h2>* Youth Tell the Truth about Tech *</h2>

<p>
  As society grapples with the unchecked power of the tech oligarchy and the speed of technological change, listening to <em>children's experiences, candid perspectives, and creative ideas</em> is essential to questioning our assumptions and finding new paths forward.
</p>

<h3>
  Its' time to listen to kids
</h3>

<p>
  <em>Youth Tell the Truth about Tech</em> is a storytelling project that amplifies young voices on key issues related to technology. While adults debate tech's impact on youth, we rarely hear directly from them. In contrast, our community-based activations, interactive installations,and podcast give kids of all ages-- from toddlers to teens-- a platform to share their personal stories and future visions about technology's role in all of our lives.
