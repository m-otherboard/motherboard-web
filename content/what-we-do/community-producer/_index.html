<h2>The Community Producer Project</h2>

<p>
  Invested fan communities can transform everything from funding to production and distribution to mobilizing for a good cause. Many people champion "democratized entertainment," but models like these require building real communities and fandoms safely. Managing healthy direct-to-fan ecosystems requires <em>a new kind of expertise</em>.
</p>

<h3>Introducing a new role</h3>

<p>
  We're creating a new role in the creative team: <em>the Community Producer</em>. This person is "above the line" on par with other producers/ directors/ artists and has the specialized skills to cultivate, strengthen, and manage a community right from the inception of the project.
</p>

<h3>Making this real</h3>

<p>
  Our first step is gathering a team of experts across impact entertainment, fandom cultivation, governance, and movement building to design the curriculum for Community Producers. Once established, we will <em>train a cohort and seed projects</em> with this new role through our organizational partners: Seed&amp;Spark and Popular Demand, with Kinema and the Center for Cultural Power, and support from Pop Culture Collab.
