  Technological dominance represents an existential threat to our democracy, planet and future generations. Our interventions include collecting narratives that share techâ€™s true impacts, archiving forgotten histories, and communicating a positive future in service to all life. We also provide infrastructure and governance to help our members meet their present needs and opportunities.

    <h3><em>A People's History of Tech</em></h3>
    <p>
      A People's History of Tech (APHOT) reframes dominant technological narratives by documenting how diverse communities have experienced, shaped, and resisted technological change. This project moves beyond established inventor-centric histories to capture contested, hidden, and forgotten pasts by amplifying marginalized voices through participatory storytelling and archival methods.
