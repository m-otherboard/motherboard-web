<h2>What does (m)otherboard do?</h2>

<p>
  Technological dominance represents an existential threat to our democracy, planet and future generations. Our interventions include collecting narratives that share tech’s true impacts, archiving forgotten histories, and communicating a positive future in service to all life. We also provide infrastructure and a <a href="/governance">participatory governance model</a> to help our members meet their present needs and opportunities.
