<p>
  As society grapples with the unchecked power of the tech oligarchy and the speed of technological change, <em>children's candid perspectives</em> and creative ideas are essential to questioning our assumptions and finding new paths forward
</p>

<p>
  All Kids Considered is a <em>(m)otherboard produced podcast</em> that amplifies young voices on key issues related to technology. While adults debate tech's impact on youth, we rarely hear directly from children themselves. Our podcast will give kids of all ages-- from toddlers to teens-- a platform to share their personal stories, hopes, and visions about technology's role in all of our lives.
