<h2>About the Book</h2>

<p><em>We Just Build Hammers</em> uses a lens of science fiction to connect today's technologists with a historical lineage of visionaries and leaders in responsible tech: from the advent of the atomic age, to the formative years of computing; from the open source revolution of the 2000s to the tech justice movement of today.</p>

<p>This book challenges technologists to consider for themselves whether they’re really just <em>“building hammers”</em>—neutral tools whose potential for good balances their potential for harm—or if they are unwittingly contributing to systems that exacerbate inequality, inequity, and injustice.</p>
