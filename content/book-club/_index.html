	Our next book is <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/m-otherboard-book-club">Blockchain Chicken Farm and Other Stories of Tech in China's Countryside</a> by Xiaowei Wang, a fascinating exploration of the political and social entanglements of technology in rural China. We're excited to welcome this latest addition to the new tech justice canon!
</p>

<p>
	Xiaowei R. Wang is an artist, writer and educator. Their research and creative practice critically examines the entanglements between technology, racial capitalism, modes of care and environmental justice, taking form through speculative fiction, prose, sculpture and textiles. They are a steward of Collective Action School and a Mancosh Fellow at Northwestern University School of Communication. In 2024 they received an Eyebeam Democracy Machine Fellowship to support their work with forms of data storage and transmission through textiles.
