<h2>About the Book</h2>

<p><em>We Just Build Hammers</em> brings to life the stories of the unsung heroes of responsible tech and the science fiction that inspired them. The book spans 100 years of history: from the advent of the atomic age, to the formative years of computing; from the open source revolution of the 2000s, to the tech justice movement of today.</p>

<p>This book challenges technologists to consider for themselves whether they’re really just <em>“building hammers”</em>—neutral tools whose potential for good balances their potential for harm—or if they are unwittingly contributing to systems that exacerbate inequality, inequity, and injustice.</p>
