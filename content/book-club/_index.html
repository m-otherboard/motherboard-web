<h2>Our First Selection</h2>

<p>We're kicking off the book club with <a href="https://thehammerbook.com">We Just Build Hammers: Stories from the Past, Present, and Future of Responsible Tech</a>, a new book by (m)otherboard godmother Coraline Ada Ehmke.</p>

<p><em>We Just Build Hammers</em> uses a lens of speculative and science fiction to connect contemporary technologists with a historical lineage of visionaries and leaders in responsible tech: from the advent of the atomic age, to the formative years of computing; from the open source revolution of the 2000s to the tech justice movement of today.</p>

<p>This book challenges technologists to consider for themselves whether they’re really just “building hammers”—tools whose potential for good balances their potential for harm—or if they are unwittingly contributing to systems that exacerbate inequality, inequity, and injustice.</p>
