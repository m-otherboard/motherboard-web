  <h2>* The (m)otherboard Manifesto v1.0 *</h2>

  <h3>(m)otherboard believes:</h3>

  <p>
    Mothering takes many forms. By (re)turning to our origins, we bend the arc of technology from individual convenience to collective good.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    We are interdependent—across generations, chosen kin, communities of care, and mother earth.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    We listen to the wisdom of our children, elders, and ancestors.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Stories are technology. Songs are technology. Rituals are technology. Houses are technology. Tables are technology.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Technology is not neutral.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Progress is nonlinear. The spiral cycles between past, present, and future.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    The future is not inevitable. It emerges from our collective imaginations.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Feelings, instincts, yearnings, and dreams are meaningful signals.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Machine learning can never replace embodied intelligence.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Rupture is inevitable and repair is divine.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Governance is a tool for moving forward, together.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Clarity is care. Everyone benefits when values are made explicit.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    We thrive in community, both online and on the ground.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    The margins are where true innovation emerges.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    Relying on the generosity of billionaires is a bad plan.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    We are planting seeds for what comes after the fall.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">*</div>

  <p>
    We cheat death not by becoming immortal, but by building a world where future generations thrive. Legacy, not life extension.
  </p>

  <div class="separator">=</div>

  <p>
    <em>We are nurturing technology you’d be proud to bring home to your mother.</em>
