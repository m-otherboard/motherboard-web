# Community Compact

[Back](/governance)

## 1\. Decision-Making Norms

We operate by consensus and make decisions through dialog, collaboration, and, when necessary, voting. Members of the organization participate at different levels of decision-making and consent based on their specific roles.

Our decision-making ladder connects four degrees of consent to governance outcomes:

1. **Agreement:** a person fully accepts the decision without reservations.
2. **Alignment:** a person is in general agreement with the decision, even if they have issues with particular details.
3. **Consent:** a person feels that they can abide by the decision, even if they disagree with it.
4. **Objection:** a person feels that they cannot act in accordance with the decision, regardless of consequences.
